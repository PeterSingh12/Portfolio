      <p className="text-zinc-400 text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        I’m a frontend developer focused on building clean and interactive web
        applications using React and modern JavaScript. I enjoy learning by
        building real projects and improving my skills through hands-on
        experience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-400 text-2xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Recently, I built a live cryptocurrency dashboard using real-time APIs
        and an interactive 3D landing page using React Three Fiber, which helped
        me strengthen my understanding of React, UI design, and performance.
